Fixed

[6.0.0] - 2020-05-05
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Renamed 'request_auth_type' to 'request_auth_type_guess'. This makes it more clear that this metric could report the wrong value in certain cases. This could break dashboards or alerts that relied on this metric.
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Renamed value `session-or-unknown` to `session-or-other`. This name makes it more clear that it is the method of authentication that is in question, not whether or not the user is authenticated. This could break dashboards or alerts that relied on this metric.

Added
~~~~~

* Added 'jwt-cookie' as new value for 'request_auth_type_guess'.
* Added new 'request_authenticated_user_found_in_middleware' metric. Helps identify for what middleware step the request user was set, if it was set. Example values: 'process_request', 'process_view', 'process_response', or 'process_exception'.

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fixed/Added setting of authentication metrics for exceptions as well.
* Fixed 'request_auth_type_guess' to be more accurate when recording values of 'unauthenticated' and 'no-user'.
